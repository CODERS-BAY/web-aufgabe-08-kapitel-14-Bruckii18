            <h2>What is a Nintento Switch?</h2>
            <p>The Nintendo Switch is a video game console developed by Nintendo, released worldwide in most regions
                on March 3, 2017. It is a hybrid console that can be used as a home console and portable device. Its
                wireless Joy-Con controllers, with standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion
                sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld-style play.
                They can also connect to a grip accessory to provide a traditional home console gamepad form, or be used
                individually in the hand like the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, supporting local multiplayer modes. The
                Nintendo Switch's software supports online gaming through Internet connectivity, as well as local
                wireless ad hoc connectivity with other consoles. Nintendo Switch games and software are available on
                both physical flash-based ROM cartridges and digital distribution via Nintendo eShop; the system has no
                region lockout. A handheld-focused revision of the system, called the Nintendo Switch Lite, was
                released on September 20, 2019.<br>
                <br>
                The Nintendo Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016. Known in development by its codename NX, the
                concept of the Switch came about as Nintendo's reaction to several quarters of financial losses into
                2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the Wii U, and market competition from mobile
                gaming. Nintendo's then-president Satoru Iwata pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel
                hardware. The Nintendo Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through
                multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset
                based on Nvidia's Tegra line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more
                compatible with existing game engines. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it
                with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many third-party developers
                and publishers to help build out the Switch's game library alongside Nintendo's first-party titles,
                including many independent video game studios. While Nintendo initially anticipated around 100 titles
                for its first year, over 320 titles from first-party, third-party, and independent developers were
                released by the end of 2017.</p>
